## Overview <br/>
This project is a comprehensive, interactive web application built with Streamlit that provides an end-to-end platform for data analysis and machine learning. The app guides users through a full data science workflow, from raw data ingestion and exploration to advanced predictive modeling and model interpretability.

Designed as a no-code tool, this application makes powerful data analysis accessible to users of all technical backgrounds while serving as a robust portfolio piece demonstrating a complete understanding of a data science pipeline.

# Key Features
## üìÇ Data Ingestion & Exploration
Multi-Format Support: Easily upload datasets in both CSV and XLSX formats.

Data Preview: Instantly view the head and tail of the dataset.

Data Integrity Checks: Automatically report on the number of rows, columns, data types, and count of null and duplicate values.

Type Mismatch Detection: Intelligent checks to identify columns that are numeric in nature but stored as text.

## üßπ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Null Value Handling: One-click option to fill all missing numerical values using the mean of their respective columns.

Duplicate Removal: Easily identify and remove duplicate rows to ensure data quality.

Outlier & Consistency Checks: Automated warnings for negative values in columns like Age or Salary, and IQR method-based outlier detection for all numerical features.

## üìä Interactive Visualizations
Dynamic Dashboard: Generate interactive charts (Scatter, Bar, Box, Histogram, Pie) in a PowerBI/Tableau-style dashboard using Plotly.

Statistical Plots: Create histograms and box plots to analyze data distributions and visualize outliers.

## ü§ñ Predictive Modeling & Advanced Techniques
This section is the core of the app and demonstrates a deep understanding of the machine learning lifecycle.

Problem Type Detection: The app automatically determines if the problem is Classification or Regression based on the target column's data.

Advanced Preprocessing: The workflow automatically performs feature selection, categorical encoding, outlier capping, and feature scaling (StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler) before training.

Class Balancing (SMOTE): For imbalanced classification datasets, the app automatically applies the SMOTE technique to balance the classes, ensuring more reliable model training.

Model Selection & Tuning: Choose from powerful models like RandomForest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression. The app uses GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters, demonstrating a mastery of model tuning.

Performance Metrics: For both regression and classification, the app provides a full suite of metrics, including R¬≤, RMSE, Accuracy, and a full Classification Report.

Model Interpretation (SHAP): Gain deep insights into model behavior with integrated SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) plots, which show how each feature contributes to the final prediction.
